        Uses kubeseal to encrypt values that `seal-secrets` controller can translate into a `kind: Secret` resource.
        To tell `seal-secrets` to create a `kind: Secret` resource, add the value returned from this task in a new resource similar to this <TODO add launchpad-starter ref>
        The referenced `SealedSecret` was created by running :
        `task: seal-secrets -- -n test -s super-secret -k TESTER_SECRET -v xyz -c default`
        Please note that `SealedSecrets` are namespace and context specific.
